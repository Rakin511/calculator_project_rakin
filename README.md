The function of a calculator is to perform mathematical calculations quickly and accurately. It is an electronic device that can perform a variety of operations, such as:

Basic Arithmetic: Adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing numbers.
Advanced Mathematical Functions: For scientific or graphing calculators, functions like square roots, trigonometry (sine, cosine, tangent), logarithms, and exponentiation.
Memory Functions: Storing intermediate results for later use.
Statistical Calculations: Calculators can compute averages, standard deviations, and other statistical measures.
Graphing: Some calculators, especially graphing ones, can plot functions and provide visual representations of data.
Conversions: Many calculators also help with unit conversions, such as converting between different currencies, measurements (e.g., inches to centimeters), or temperature units (Celsius to Fahrenheit).
In short, a calculator is a tool that helps simplify mathematical processes, saving time and reducing the likelihood of errors.



Create a GitHub account (if you donâ€™t have one).
Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., calculator).
2. Create Project Files
Create a folder on your computer for the project.
Add files:
index.html: Structure for the calculator layout.
styles.css: Basic styling for the calculator.
script.js: JavaScript for functionality (operations, display, etc.).
3. Initialize Git Repository Locally
Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
Run the following commands:
bash
Copy code
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
4. Push Project to GitHub
Link the local repo to GitHub:
bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/calculator.git
Push your project:
bash
Copy code
git push -u origin master
5. Enable GitHub Pages (Optional)
Go to Settings > GitHub Pages > Source and choose master branch to publish your site.
Now your calculator project is live on GitHub!
